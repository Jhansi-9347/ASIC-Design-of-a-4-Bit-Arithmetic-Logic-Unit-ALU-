# ASIC-Design-of-a-4-Bit-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-ALU-
This project presents the design and implementation of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using the ASIC design flow from RTL to GDSII. The ALU is capable of performing fundamental arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR. Register Transfer Level (RTL) coding was developed in Verilog to define the functional behavior of the ALU, and.Synopsys Design Compiler was employed for logic synthesis, optimizing the design for area, speed, and power efficiency. Static Timing Analysis (STA) using Synopsys PrimeTime ensured proper timing closure, while formal verification techniques validated the functional equivalence between the RTL and gate-level netlists. Place and Route (P&R) were carried out using Synopsys IC Compiler to achieve optimal floorplanning and routing. Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification confirmed layout integrity, and the final GDSII file was generated, ready for fabrication in a semiconductor foundry. This work demonstrates a complete ASIC frontend and partial backend implementation for a low-power, compact ALU design.
